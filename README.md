# Movie_Recommendation_System
A simple machine learning project that suggests movies based on user preferences.

While interning at the YBI Foundation, I did this project by learning machine learning modules.


This project develops a recommendation system that suggests movies based on user preferences. It uses a movie dataset and applies machine learning techniques, including TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, to find and recommend similar movies. Key steps include importing and preprocessing data, combining features, and modeling. The system leverages libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Difflib for implementation.
